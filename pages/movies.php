							<h3>Sugar</h3>
						</div>
						<p>When Dominican pitcher, Miguel "Sugar" Santos, is recruited to play baseball for the U.S. minor leagues, he does everything he can to make it to the majors in order to pull his family out of poverty. At 19, Miguel has become a celebrity in the small village he lives outside San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic. His neighbors gather to welcome him when he comes home on the weekends, the children beg for extra baseballs and old gloves, and his family depends on him after his father died. He starts building his family a home with the small bonus he gets after being signed, but the pressure to perform makes him question if it'll ever get done.</p>
