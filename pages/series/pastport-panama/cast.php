							<h3>Tatyana Ali</h3>
						</div>
						
						
						
Panamanian-American actress Tatyana Ali grew up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood on Long Island and later relocated to Los Angeles, where she found fame as the loveable Ashley Banks on <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>. But her parents' family history and move to America, where they encountered racial barriers and financial hardships, comprised a lifestyle that was the polar opposite of her privileged TV family.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The 32-year-old actress' father is Trinidadian and her mother, Sonia, grew up in Panama but left her homeland in 1968 at age 16, when she learned to adjust to a new way of life in New York State. Sonia's family struggled to fit in within New York's great melting pot, a feat that proved difficult because their Panamanian identity set them apart from the close-knit African American community, and they didn't fit the traditional Latino mold.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Tatyana and her two younger sisters, Anastasia and Kimberly, grew up embracing Panamanian culture in the Ali household, where the family often indulged in Panamanian food, music and dance. Tatyana's love of the arts led her to pursue a career in entertainment, and before she was barely out of diapers she was singing alongside Big Bird on <i>Sesame Street</i>. She landed on <i>Fresh Prince</i> five years later and managed to balance a successful acting and music career that includes chart-topping collaborations with superstars like her sitcom co-star Will Smith and Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. Her 1999 pop-R&amp;B debut album, <i>Kiss the Sky</i>, was certified gold and spawned the Billboard hit "Daydreamin'." Tatyana's been busy lately starring in the TV One sitcom <i>Love That Girl!&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Even more impressive, somewhere along the way, the tireless artist managed to find time to launch her own production company, Hazrah Entertainment, and earn a bachelor's degree in African-American history and political science from Harvard in 2002.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>All things considered, it's no wonder why the L.A.-based Caribbean Heritage Organization bestowed the brainy beauty with its Living Legacy Award earlier this year.</div>
