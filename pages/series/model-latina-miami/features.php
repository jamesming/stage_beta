			<h2>Codie Talks South Africa & O Magazine!</h2>
			<img class="bordered media" src="/assets/images/featured/codie_0-Features_458x248.jpg" />
			<p>Just when we thought Codie couldn't make us any more proud, she announces her next big spread<span style="font-style: italic;"> for</span><em> <a href="http://www.oprah.com/omagazine.html">O Magazine</a></em>. Yes, that's Oprah's magazine. I spoke to the rising model to find out how this all happened.</p>
			<p><strong>First of all. How did the opportunity to model in South Africa come about? </strong>Jeffrey called me one day and asked if I was willing to travel internationally. A month later, I received a call informing me that an agency wants me in Cape Town, South Africa for 3 months! It turned out to be a 20-hour flight. Thank goodness I went to karaoke the night before with Jessica Caban and some other friends. I was able sleep the majority of the flight. I'll be here until mid April. It makes me want to travel the world, and modeling can help me do that. I hope India's next.</p>
			<p><strong>How's the living situation working out for you?</strong> I'm currently living in the Western Cape of South Africa in a beautiful apartment with three other models. It's absolutely breath taking. One of the models I live with&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10122011@N04/4814122193/">Naoumie Ekiko</a>&mdash;is from Q as well. I met her for the first time at the airport. The other models&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deviouselements/4854574585/ ">Laticia Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/portfolio/413015/viewall">Adriana Gerardino</a>&mdash;are with <a href="http://www.wilhelmina.com/index.cfm">Wilhelmina</a>. One of my biggest fears was living with other models, but we've grown to be like sisters.</p>
			<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a typical day like for you?</strong> I wake up early and get my morning workout in. Then I head to my agency to see what briefs I have for the week. I go to my castings&mdash;could be one to three a day&mdash;and often find myself getting lost and on some kind of adventure. Never fails. Most are walking distance, so I get to do a lot of sightseeing along the way. After my castings, I'll meet up with friends and either go hiking, to the beach, or to some kind of braai, a South African BBQ. I usually end my day with a hot yoga session before a night out on the town. Tonight, it's salsa dancing!</p>
			<p><strong>How&rsquo;s modeling in Cape Town different from New York? </strong>There's not much of a difference when it comes to modeling. I <em>am</em> one of the few Latinas though. I'm here to represent for my Latinas! ;)</p>
			<p><strong>Wow. We're so proud of you! What's this I hear about <em>O</em> <em>Magazine</em>?</strong> Yup. I'm flying out to Johannesburg next week for a six-page spread for <a href="http://www.oprah.com/omagazine.html"><em>O Magazine</em></a>! I wake up wanting to pinch myself sometimes. I can't believe how fortunate I am to be in South Africa living my dream. So many of my dreams are coming true and I have the Lord, my family, an amazing agency and S&iacute; TV to thank for helping me get here. It goes to show you can achieve anything no matter what obstacles come your way. Never give up!!!</p>
			<p><strong>Thanks Codie. We love you.</strong></p>
